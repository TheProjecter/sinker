Lessons Learned:

 - Process: Design HTML, CSS, and non-widget JS.  Preview in Safari.  Add
   widget-specific JS.
 
 - Preview your widget in Safari, not Firefox.  Dashboard apparently uses the
   Safari engine, so using Safari, WYSIWYG.
   
 - Everything in the style sheet must have an absolute position. No position,
   then no rendering. This isn't true in Safari, but it is true in Dashboard.
   
 - Turn off all padding and margins in order to ensure that your absolute
   positions are really absolute.
   
 - You can't use async. widget.system() with short-running processes because
   your endHandler() will never get called.
